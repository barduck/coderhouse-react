# This is my final project for the course "Frontend developer with React" from Coderhouse

_This project is a React adaptation of [my other final project made with vanilla javascript](https://github.com/barduck/mercadogris)._

## Main functionalities required to approve

-   Product catalog connected to Firebase
-   Cart system
-   Checkout that generates an order in Firebase

## Extra functionalities that I wanted to apply on my own

-   Loader
-   Searcher
-   Discount with promo code
-   Acceptable looking design

Also as a personal challenge, I set out to use pure Bootstrap with no additional CSS spritesheet, forcing me to learn the logic of the library.
