# Graymarket

This is my final project for the "Front-end developer with React" career at Coderhouse.

_This project is a React adaptation of [my other final project made with vanilla JavaScript](https://github.com/zevamaru/mercadogris)._

## Main functionalities required to approve 👇
-   Catalog of products connected to Firebase
-   Cart system
-   Checkout that generates an order in Firebase

## Extra functionalities that I wanted to apply on my own ☝
-   Loader
-   Searcher
-   Discount with promo code
-   Acceptable looking design

### 🗒 Final notes
- As a personal challenge I set out to use pure Bootstrap without any additional CSS spritesheet, which force me to learn the logic of the library.
- I was qualified as a Top 10 student for this project.
