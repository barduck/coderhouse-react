# Graymarket

This is my final project for the "Frontend developer with React" career at Coderhouse.

_This project is a React adaptation of [my other final project made with vanilla javascript](https://github.com/zevamaru/mercadogris)._

## Main functionalities required to approve üëá

-   Product catalog connected to Firebase
-   Cart system
-   Checkout that generates an order in Firebase

## Extra functionalities that I wanted to apply on my own ‚òù

-   Loader
-   Searcher
-   Discount with promo code
-   Acceptable looking design

Also as a personal challenge, I set out to use pure Bootstrap with no additional CSS spritesheet, forcing me to learn the logic of the library.
